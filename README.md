# Machine_Learning_Project_2018

First of all you should download the dataset from this link: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
Then put the directory "aclImdb" in the principal directory of the project.
So to obtain the csv dataset launch "create_dataset.py".

Now you can use the script "logistic_regression" to see the first way to obtain the classifier, else you can use "out_of_core.py"
to obtain similar results in few time (this script is necessary for the application).

"example.py" is a simple test to check if a new review is good or not.
"create_database.py" create a new sqlite database for the application where you can start.

If you want to test your new review or to train with new reviews the system, you can launch "app.py"
